# Course Submission
The course was designed to introduce about Web3 and also get started with some solidity programming.You get a challenge at the end of all there given modules.

## Beginning
I wrote code using the given programming language its solidity programming by taking a proper guidance.

## Task
I had a challenge to make a contract on the basis to mint and burn the token, where I make a three variable : two strings and one uint
1. Strings as tokenname with a value of "active"
2. Strings as tokenabbr (Abbreviation) with a value of "space"
3. uint as a totalsupply (Which I initially set as to be zero)

### Task Run 
* Here I used Online Remix IDE Compiler for writing the code.
* Then I created a file which is present in the repository named as tanveeEVM.sol .

### Task Execution
* If you are using Remix IDE, you can simply compile the code with the help of compile option present at a Menu Bar.
* After compiling, you have to deploy the Contract from the side bar itself. And after deploying you have to enter some inputs which is require to the smart contract.

## Experience
